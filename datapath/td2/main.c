 * It looked like a rate limit somewhere in the SDK, and it was this. The 1000
 * ms passed to the pump is a poll TIMEOUT -- the longest it will wait when
 * nothing is happening -- and never a guarantee of how often this is called.
 *
 * The guards below fixed the rate. They did not fix the thread: this still ran
 * where packets are moved, so once a second the packet path stopped for as long
 * as a FIB mirror takes. Measured from the AS5610 pinging this box, that showed
 * up as a steady 5-26 ms with a spike to 82-118 ms about once a second, against
 * 1 ms to a neighbour that answers in hardware. So it runs on its own thread
