/*
 * The SDK's view of the chip: soc_cm_device_vectors_t over our userspace BDE.
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE SHAPE IT IS
 *
 * The SDK reaches the device through these vectors and nothing else. That is
 * the property the whole design rests on: fill in fourteen function pointers
 * and everything above them is unmodified vendor code, including the Trident2
 * MMU and LLS initialisation that hand-reproduction repeatedly failed to match
 * on this silicon. Chip initialisation is deliberately not ours to write.
 *
 * The sequence the SDK expects (include/soc/cmext.h:13,75,121):
 *
 *     soc_cm_init()                            once
 *     soc_cm_device_create(dev_id, rev_id, c)  -> unit number
 *     soc_cm_device_init(unit, &vectors)       installs these
 *
 * The cookie passed to device_create comes back in every vector as
 * dev->cookie (include/soc/cmtypes.h:47), which is how a vector with no
 * context of its own finds the BDE it belongs to. That matters because it is
 * the only per-device state these functions get: everything else about the
 * mapping lives in struct nosaic_bde.
