/*
 * A userspace BDE for the Broadcom SDK.
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The SDK ships its own BDE as a pair of kernel modules. Their newest version
 * guard is Linux 4.16 and they use interfaces removed since -- ioremap_nocache
 * went in 5.6 -- while NOSaic runs 6.12. Carrying a patch set for them would
 * mean owning it for as long as these boards live.
 *
 * It is also unnecessary. EOS reaches this same chip with no arbitrating
 * driver at all: several of its agents hold live mappings of the ASIC's PCI
 * BAR simultaneously. The BDE's job is small enough to do the same way, and
 * everything above it is then unmodified SDK -- which matters, because the
 * Trident2 MMU and LLS initialisation are precisely the sequences that
 * hand-reproduction repeatedly failed to match.
 *
 * WHAT IT IMPLEMENTS
 *
 * soc_cm_device_vectors_t, defined at include/soc/cmtypes.h:63 of the SDK.
 * Fourteen function pointers; the mapping is:
 *
 *   read/write            mmap of the ASIC's BAR0 through sysfs resource0
 *   pci_conf_read/write   /sys/bus/pci/devices/<bdf>/config
 *   salloc/sfree          a reserved physically contiguous region via /dev/mem
 *   l2p/p2l               base plus offset, because the region is at a known
 *                         physical address rather than paged
 *   sflush/sinval         nothing: x86 DMA is coherent
 *   interrupt_*           nothing: the SDK polls when none is connected
 *
 * THE DMA REGION
 *
 * The SDK wants a contiguous physical pool. A pagemap lookup gives single
 * pages, which is fine for one descriptor and not for a pool, so the region is
 * reserved on the kernel command line instead:
 *
 *     memmap=64M$0xd0000000 iomem=relaxed      (on the 7050SX2)
 *
 * The dollar marks it reserved, so the kernel never touches it and physical
 * addresses are base plus offset. An image that omits that argument will
 * initialise the chip and then fail at the first DMA, which does not look like
 * a missing kernel argument -- so the board records it and boot0 sets it.
