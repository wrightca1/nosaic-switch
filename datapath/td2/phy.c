/*
 * The 48 external copper PHYs on the Arista 7050TX-64.
 *
 * Neither board that came before this one has an external PHY: their cages are
 * direct SerDes, and the chip drives them end to end. Here every front-panel
 * port below the QSFP cages is 10GBASE-T behind a BCM84848 that runs its own
 * firmware, reached over the board controller's MDIO bus.
 *
 * The SDK owns the PHY itself -- its phy8481 driver downloads the firmware and
 * runs link training, given load_firmware and phy_bus_i2c_<n> in asic.conf.
 * What the SDK does NOT do is keep the switch chip's side of the port agreeing
 * with what the PHY negotiated on the wire, and that is what this file is for.
 *
 * ⚠ THE MAC INTERFACE MUST FOLLOW THE NEGOTIATED SPEED.
 *
 * A 10GBASE-T port left at its XFI default while the copper side negotiates 1G
 * gives a PHY with a real link on BOTH sides that bridges nothing between them.
 * Both ends report the port up, both transmit, neither receives, and there are
 * zero errors on either side -- so every status the SDK offers says the port is
 * fine. It reads as a dead cable and it is a one-line configuration mismatch.
 *
 * SGMII at or below 2.5G, XFI at 10G.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS WRITTEN EVEN WHEN IT ALREADY READS BACK CORRECT.
 *
 * This file used to read the interface first and write only on a mismatch,
 * carried over from the sibling board where re-applying a setting a 40G port
 * already had left both its ports linked at the PCS and deaf at the MAC.
 *
 * That lesson does not transfer, and skipping the write is what kept the 48
 * copper ports silent. A port that negotiates 10G wants XFI, XFI is also the
 * chip's default, and the SDK's own linkscan moves the MAC there on link-up --
 * so the value matched, nothing was written, and the port passed not one frame
 * in either direction with every status saying it was fine. There was not a
 * single line of this file's output in the log to say so.
 *
 * Reading the field back is not evidence the port was configured. It is the
 * field's default, and on this board it is not even stable: a late-cabled port
 * accepted an interface change and silently reverted to XFI afterwards.
 *
 * The predecessor never had the bug because it never made the check -- it sets
 * the interface unconditionally for any external-PHY port that reports a real
 * speed, and its copper ports carried traffic. So does this now.
 *
 * The sibling's warning is still real, and what keeps it satisfied is that this
 * happens ONCE PER LINK EVENT, not on a timer: phy_matched[] is set on success
 * and cleared only when the link drops. Re-applying repeatedly is the harm;
 * applying once to a port that just came up is the bring-up.
 *
 * ⚠ MDIO IS A SHARED BUS AND THE DATAPATH DEPENDS ON IT.
 *
 * bcm_port_speed_get on a port behind an external PHY is an MDIO round trip.
 * Issuing 48 of them on a two-second timer starved the bus badly enough to kill
 * copper RECEIVE on every port, while the direct-SerDes 40G ports carried on
 * working -- proven by rolling back the binary that did it. So: link state
 * comes from bcm_port_link_status_get, which is software state linkscan
 * maintains and costs nothing; the speed read happens only for a port that has
 * link and has not been matched yet, and at most PHY_READS_PER_PASS of those
 * per pass.
 *
 * A port is matched once and then left alone until its link drops, which is the
 * event that can change the negotiated speed.

 *
 * led.c lights ports 1-48 through SCD blocks at 0x6100 + 0x10*n, and its own
 * comment calls them "SFP+" -- because on the sibling they are SFP+ cages and
 * that is where those blocks come from. This board's ports 1-48 are 10GBASE-T
 * behind BCM84848s, and the board description file creates LED blocks only for
 * status, fan, both PSUs and the sixteen QSFP lanes. Writing 0x6100+ here
 * addresses nothing and reports success, which is why the panel was dark.
 *
 * The real control is PHY register 1.0xa83b: five 3-bit mode fields, where 0 is
 * dark, 2 is lit, 3 is the parked state the driver's halt path writes, and 4
 * means "the PHY's own firmware drives this". The vendor OS holds all five at 4
 * and lets firmware flip field 0 to 2 on link -- 0x4924 down, 0x4922 up.
 *
 * OUR firmware never writes the register at all, so the field that is supposed
 * to follow link simply never moves. That is the difference, and it is why
 * matching the vendor's three configuration registers is necessary and still
 * lights nothing on its own: something has to write 0xa83b, and here it is us.
 *
 * ★ AND THE CONDITION IS LINK **AND** SPEED, NOT LINK.
 *
 * Every copper port on this board reports link with the driver bound, cable or
 * not -- "Link Up with Speed 0M!". Gating on link alone lights all 48 with
 * nothing plugged in, which looks like a working panel and is worse than a dark
 * one. phy_matched[] is already exactly "has link and a real negotiated speed",
 * so the LED follows it rather than a second, weaker test.

 * other PMA registers agree exactly between the two paths, so this is not
 * the wrong register space; the driver simply does not serve 1.10 from the
 * wire, and the part does not answer it there.
 *
 * Reading raw cost this investigation a long detour: sigdet reading zero on

 * The enable above is the same bit on every board carrying a BCM84328, so it
 * is compiled in. These are not: they are per-PCB values the board vendor
 * established for one set of trace lengths, they are read from a file
 * generated on the switch by tools/mkretimer.sh, and they are not ours to
 * invent. A cage with no lines runs the part's power-up defaults, which is a
 * working link and an untuned one -- so this says nothing and does nothing
 * rather than reaching for a number. The sibling Arista boards' repeater
 * driver reached the same conclusion for the same reason: unprogrammed is a
 * fault you can see, and wrongly programmed is a link that works until it
 * does not.
 *
 * Keyed by logical port, because nothing guarantees six cages on one board
 * want the same values -- the SerDes polarity on this board does not.
